        Hi! I'm a pwnagotchi {{pwnagotchi.version}}, please take good care of me!
        Here are some basic things you need to know to raise me properly!

        If you want to change my configuration, use /etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml

        All the configuration options can be found on /etc/pwnagotchi/default.toml,
        but don't change this file because I will recreate it every time I'm restarted!

        I use oPwnGrid as my main API, you can check stats at https://opwngrid.xyz

        I'm managed by systemd. Here are some basic commands.

        If you want to know what I'm doing, you can check my logs with the command
        - pwnlog
        - pwnver, to check the current version
        - sudo pwnagotchi --donate, to see how you can donate to this project
        - sudo pwnagotchi --check-update, to see if there is a new version available

        If you want to know if I'm running, you can use
        systemctl status pwnagotchi

        You can restart me using
        systemctl restart pwnagotchi
